# Let us try to perform Mean Filtering Techniques on this image.
# The idea of mean filtering is simply to replace each pixel value in an image with the mean (`averageâ€™) value of its neighbours,
# including itself. This has the effect of eliminating pixel values that are unrepresentative of their surroundings. 
# Mean filtering is usually thought of as a convolution filter. Like other convolutions, it is based around a kernel, which represents the shape and size of the neighbourhood to be sampled when calculating the mean.

# Bilateral filter
# A Bilateral filter is a non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing smoothing filter for images.
# It replaces the intensity of each pixel with a weighted average of intensity values from nearby pixels.
# This weight can be based on a Gaussian distribution.
